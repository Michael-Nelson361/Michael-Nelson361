### Hi there!

I am a student at Codeup learning about data science!

I was inspired to learn about AI from Ray Kurzweil and the movie Transcendence, and now I want to build systems to help advance the healthcare industry.

I'm excited to learn more about data science from my awesome instructors here at Codeup!
